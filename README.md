gruf is a Ruby framework that wraps the [gRPC Ruby library](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) to
provide a more streamlined integration into Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.

It provides an abstracted server and client for gRPC services, along with other tools to help get gRPC services in Ruby
up fast and efficiently at scale. Some of its features include:

* Abstracted controllers with request context support
* Full interceptors with timing and unified request context support
* Robust client error handling and metadata transport abilities
* Server authentication via interceptors, with basic auth with multiple key support built in
* TLS support for client-server auth, though we recommend using [linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) instead
* Error data serialization in output metadata to allow fine-grained error handling in the transport while
  still preserving gRPC BadStatus codes
* Server and client execution timings in responses

gruf currently has active support for gRPC 1.10.x+. gruf is compatible and tested with Ruby 3.0-3.4.
gruf is also not [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)-specific, and can be used in any Ruby framework
(such as [Grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) or [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org/), for instance).

### Getting Started

Please see the [gruf wiki](https://github.com/bigcommerce/gruf/wiki) for detailed information on getting started
using gruf.

## Demo Rails App

There is a [demonstration Rails application here](https://github.com/bigcommerce/gruf-demo) you can
view and clone that shows how to integrate Gruf into an existing Rails application.
