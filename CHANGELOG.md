- Bump rubocop to 0.64, address violations, update activesupport/concurrent-ruby dependencies to have a min version

### 2.5.2

- Log ok/validation responses at DEBUG levels to prevent log stampeding in high-volume environments

### 2.5.1

- Ensure `timeout` is an int when passed as a client option to a gRPC client
- Add `bound_service` reader to `Gruf::Controllers::Base` for finding the service bound to the given controller

### 2.5.0

- Client exceptions raised now contain mapped subclasses, such as `Gruf::Client::Errors::InvalidArgument`
- Client exceptions will also now catch StandardError and GRPC::Core errors, and handle them as Internal errors
- Added SynchronizedClient which prevents multiple calls to the same endpoint with the same params at
  a given time. This is useful for mitigating thundering herds. To skip this behavior for certain endpoints,
  pass the `options[:unsynchronized_methods]` param with a list of method names (as symbols).

### 2.4.2

- Added error handling for GRPC::Core::CallError, a low-level error in the grpc library that does not inherit
  from StandardError. [#59]
- Removed `Thread.abort\_on\_exception = true`. Exceptions should be handled by gruf or the application,
  and should not cause the server process to crash. [#59]
- Added guard for size of trailing metadata attached to grpc call. The default max for http2 trailing metadata
  in the gRPC C library is 8kb. If we go over that limit (either through custom metadata attached to the
  error by the application, or via the error payload encoded by the error serializer), the gRPC library
  will throw RESOURCE\_EXHAUSTED. Gruf now detects this case, and attempts to prevent it by logging the
  original error and substituting it with an internal error indicating that the metadata was too large. [#60]
- Truncate stack trace in error payload to help avoid overflowing the trailing metadata. Added backtrace\_limit
  configuration parameter, which defaults to 10.[#60]

### 2.4.1

- Safer configuration of GRPC::RpcServer. From now on, use `Gruf.rpc_server_options` for the params
  to be sent to GPRC::RpcServer. Also provide sane defaults for params for GRPC::RpcServer. [#55]
- Added ability to monitor `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and `UNIMPLEMENTED`. By setting `event_listener_proc` in
  the Gruf configuration, you will receive a callback when these events occur. The parameter to your
  callback will be a symbol (`:thread_pool_exhausted` or `:unimplemented`). Others may be added in the future.

### 2.4.0

- Added a hash of error log levels to RequestLogging interceptor, mapping error code to level of logging to use. To
override the level of logging per error response, provide a map of codes to log level in options, key :log_levels.
The default is :error log level.

### 2.3.0

- Add Gruf::Interceptors::ClientInterceptor for intercepting outbound client calls

### 2.1.0

registry
- Ensure interceptors and services cannot be adjusted on the server after it starts to
