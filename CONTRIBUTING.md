# Contributing to gruf

## Pull Requests

First ensure that your feature isn't already being developed or considered (see open PRs and issues). 
If it is, please consider contributing to those initiatives.

For new features, consider whether a new plugin or hook is a more beneficial solution. We'd like to keep
gruf light and minimal, and delegate adaptive functionality out into separate plugins.

All PRs require test coverage to be accepted when applicable.

## Issues / Bugs
 
* Please include a clear, specific title and replicable description.

* Please include your environment, OS, and any exceptions/backtraces that occur. The more
information that is given, the more likely we can debug and fix the issue.

**If you find a security bug, please do not post as an issue. Send directly to security@bigcommerce.com 
instead.**

## Other Ways to Contribute

* Consider contributing to gruf documentation on the wiki, reporting bugs, contributing to test coverage,
or helping spread the word about gruf.

* Contribute directly to gRPC! This helps gruf and all other initiatives.
